Our code adds onto Ultralytic's model. Link to Ultralytic's pre-trained model on the COCO dataset and manual guide can be accessed here: https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/coco/.

"YOLO v8 ultralytics code.ipynb" file contains our code to run the pre-trained model on our Google street-view images.

"analyze_paired_data_features.R" file contains our R code to run all our paired sample t-test.

Detailed steps of what each code chunk does are listed in the files.
